Python Countdown Timer

A simple countdown timer written in Python. This project demonstrates how to create a basic timer that counts down from a user-defined number of seconds and displays the time remaining in a clock-like format.

Features
Countdown timer with minute:second (MM:SS) formatting.
Real-time updates in the terminal, with the timer overwriting itself on the same line.
Input validation to ensure the user provides a valid number of seconds.
Friendly message ("Time's up!") when the countdown is complete.
How to Use
Clone or download the project:

Clone the repository using Git:

git clone <repository-url>
Or simply download the Python file.
Run the script:

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
Run the Python file using:
bash
Copy code
python timer.py
Enter the countdown time:

When prompted, enter the countdown time in seconds.
Example:
css
Copy code
Enter the time in seconds: 120
Watch the countdown:

The timer will start and display the remaining time in the format MM:SS.
Once the countdown finishes, you'll see:
css
Copy code
Time's up!
Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your system.
No additional libraries or dependencies are required; the program uses the built-in time module.
Example Output
Here’s an example of what you’ll see in the terminal:

makefile
Copy code
Enter the time in seconds: 90
01:30
01:29
01:28
...
00:01
Time's up!
Customizations
Want to add more features? Here are some ideas:

Sound Notification: Add a sound when the timer ends using the playsound or winsound library.
GUI Version: Build a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter or PyQt.
Pause/Resume: Enhance the timer to support pausing and resuming the countdown.
Timer Reset: Allow the user to restart the timer without exiting the program.
