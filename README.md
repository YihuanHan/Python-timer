Python Countdown Timer

A simple countdown timer written in Python. This project demonstrates how to create a basic timer that counts down from a user-defined number of seconds and displays the time remaining in a clock-like format.

Features

Countdown timer with minute:second (MM:SS) formatting.

Real-time updates in the terminal, with the timer overwriting itself on the same line.

Input validation to ensure the user provides a valid number of seconds.

Friendly message ("Time's up!") when the countdown is complete.
